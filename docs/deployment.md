# Terraform Cloud Project Deployment

This README provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy this Terraform project using Terraform Cloud. Terraform Cloud is a hosted service that allows you to manage your infrastructure with collaborative features, remote execution, and secure storage of your Terraform state.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. A Terraform Cloud account. Sign up for a free account at [app.terraform.io](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account).
2. [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) - Install the appropriate version for your operating system.
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Install Git for your operating system.
4. An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
5. A text editor for modifying configuration files.

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the Terraform project using Terraform Cloud:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-project.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd terraform-project
```

### 1.1. Set up AWS User Permissions

Before deploying the Terraform project, ensure that the AWS user associated with your `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` has the necessary permissions to create and manage resources. The user must have at least the following IAM policies attached:

- `AmazonRDSFullAccess`: This policy allows Terraform to create and manage RDS instances and associated resources such as parameter groups and subnet groups.
- `AmazonS3FullAccess`: This policy allows Terraform to create and manage S3 buckets and objects, which are used in this file to upload a JSON configuration file to an S3 bucket.
- `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`: This policy allows Terraform to read information about the subnets used in the subnet group created in this file.
- `IAMFullAccess`: This policy allows Terraform to create and manage IAM roles, which are used in this file to create an IAM role for RDS to import MySQL backups from S3.

Note that the exact policies required may depend on your specific environment and use case, and it is recommended to review and limit the permissions granted by each policy to the minimum required for Terraform to function properly.

To attach these policies to an existing AWS user or to create a new user with these permissions, follow the [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html).

### 2. Create a New Workspace in Terraform Cloud

Log in to your Terraform Cloud account and create a new workspace. Choose the "Version control workflow" option and connect your version control provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). Select the repository you cloned earlier.

### 3. Configure Variables

In this project, configuration variables are stored in a `config.json` file. The file should include the following variables:

```json
{
  "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1",
  "AWS_PROFILE": "dlaas",
  "SERVICE_NAME": "dlaas",
  "SERVICE_DOMAIN": "datalayer.storage",
  "DEFAULT_S3_BUCKET": "dlaas",
  "DONATION_ADDRESS": "xch1am3lgxqhqyp6g7ulxx98kzl85w724mecpyydsqlfrtdpme9strwsacnsx7",
  "DB_INSTANCE_CLASS": "db.t3.micro"
}
```

You can modify these variables according to your requirements. Keep in mind that SERVICE_DOMAIN and DEFAULT_S3_BUCKET must be changed so they do not conflict with other instances on AWS.

Additionally, you need to set up the `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` in the "Variables" tab of your Terraform Cloud workspace. Make sure to mark these variables as "Sensitive" to prevent them from being exposed in logs.

#### DONATION_ADDRESS

The `DONATION_ADDRESS` variable is an optional configuration that sends a small portion of the earnings to the provided XCH address to help fund further development. While it is not required to have this field filled out, your contribution will greatly support the ongoing development of this product.

### 3.1. Purchase a Domain (If Necessary)

If you don't already have a domain for hosting this project, you'll need to purchase one. The domain's nameservers must be set to the nameservers generated by AWS Route 53 when they become available. This step is necessary to obtain an SSL certificate for the SaaS product, ensuring secure communication between your users and the service.

Once you have purchased a domain, proceed with the rest of the deployment steps. Remember to update the `SERVICE_DOMAIN` variable in the `config.json` file with your purchased domain.

After deploying the infrastructure with Terraform Cloud, you'll need to update the nameservers for your domain to point to the AWS Route 53 hosted zone created by the project. This step is crucial to ensure the proper functioning of the SSL certificate and the overall security of the SaaS product.

### 4. Configure Terraform Cloud Settings

In your Terraform Cloud workspace, navigate to the "Settings" tab and configure the following options:

- **Terraform version**: Choose the Terraform version that matches your project's requirements.
- **Apply method**: Choose "Auto apply" if you want Terraform Cloud to automatically apply changes when a new commit is pushed to the repository, or "Manual apply" if you prefer to review and confirm the changes manually.

Save your settings.

### 5. Trigger a Run

Once your workspace is configured, you can trigger a run by pushing changes to the connected Git repository or manually queueing a run in the Terraform Cloud workspace. Terraform Cloud will perform a `terraform init`, `terraform validate`, and `terraform plan` before applying the changes.

### 6. Review and Apply Changes

If you have configured the "Manual apply" option, review the generated plan in the "Runs" tab of your Terraform Cloud workspace. If the changes align with your expectations, confirm and apply the plan.

### 7. Verify Deployment

Once the apply operation completes successfully, check the AWS Management Console or use the AWS CLI to verify that the resources have been created.

### 8. Destroy the Infrastructure (Optional)

If you need to destroy the infrastructure created by this Terraform project, you can manually queue a new run in the Terraform Cloud workspace with the "Destroy Infrastructure" option enabled. Review and confirm the destruction plan.
