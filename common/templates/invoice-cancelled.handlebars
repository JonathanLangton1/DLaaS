    <h1>{{serviceName}} Invoice Cancellation Notification</h1>
    <p>
      We are writing to inform you that your recent invoice, number
      {{invoiceNumber}}, has been cancelled and is no longer active as it was
      not paid within 90 days. This means that no payment is required from your
      end at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this invoice was for a new subscription, please note that your
      subscription has not been activated. If this invoice was for a renewal,
      your subscription has now been cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to continue the subscription, a new subscription must be
      requested.
    </p>
